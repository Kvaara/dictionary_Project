# dictionary_Project
Just a sample python project where the program takes in an user input (a word) and prints out what the word means.
Uses a JSON database (dictionaryData.json).

This project uses python 3.9 and I just implemented the use of MongoDB databases for the dictionary data.
You need python 3 (preferably 3.9) and you need to download the MongoDB Community Server to be able to use/try this project.

This was my first python project so I have a lot of things to learn. I just wanted to test how python works and how different the use of MongoDB in NodeJS is compared to Python. Not that bad!
